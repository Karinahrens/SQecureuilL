        Streets not swept <p  class="justified-text">
        We sweep every residential street at least once a week. Busy shopping areas such as Riverside Avenue, Willowbrook Lane, Maplewood Street, Sunflower Boulevard, Brookside Drive, Cedarwood Crescent, Meadowview Lane and Oakridge Avenue are swept continuously between the hours of 6am to 10pm, seven days a week. 
        <p></p>
        Main highways are cleaned daily, in the mornings and again in the afternoon. Mechanical sweeping machines are used on our main roads and also assist in sweeping residential streets. 
        <p></p>
        As part of your road being swept, weeds are also removed by our staff, in conjunction with a programme of weed spraying thatâ€™s carried out three times a year. And our busy parks are cleared of litter during the summer six days a week.
