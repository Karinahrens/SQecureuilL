        <h1>Streets not Swept</h1>

        <p>We are committed to maintaining clean and well-kept streets in our community. Here's how we handle street sweeping:</p>
    
        <h3>Residential Streets</h3>
        <p>We sweep every residential street at least once a week to ensure cleanliness and safety. Our efforts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuous sweeping of busy shopping areas, including Riverside Avenue, Willowbrook Lane, Maplewood Street, Sunflower Boulevard, Brookside Drive, Cedarwood Crescent, Meadowview Lane, and Oakridge Avenue between 6 am to 10 pm, seven days a week.</li>
            <li>Use of mechanical sweeping machines on main roads, which also assist in sweeping residential streets.</li>
            <li>Weed removal by our staff as part of the sweeping process, along with a program of weed spraying carried out three times a year.</li>
            <li>Cleaning our busy parks of litter during the summer six days a week.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Main Highways</h3>
        <p>Main highways are cleaned daily, both in the mornings and again in the afternoon, to maintain safe and accessible road conditions.</p>
