        <h3>How it Works:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Report and Prioritize:</strong> When you encounter an issue in your neighborhood, you can quickly and easily report it through the app. Your report will be received and recorded, and that's where the magic begins. We don't just stop at collecting reports; we take it a step further.</li>
            <li><strong>Democracy in Action:</strong> Your report isn't just another piece of data; it's a potential catalyst for change. Once you submit a report, the Florin County Council App allows you and your fellow community members to vote on the reports that matter most to you. This unique feature enables us to prioritize and address issues based on the number of votes they receive.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Two Ways to Participate:</h3>
        <p><strong>Submit a Report:</strong> If you come across a problem or have an idea for improving your community, you can easily create a report detailing the issue and your proposed solution. Your report will be shared with others who can vote to show their support.</p>
        <p><strong>Vote on Reports:</strong> Browse through the reports on the Post Page to see what's trending and relevant in your area. By voting on the reports you believe in, you can influence which issues the County Council addresses first.</p>
