        Fly-tipping: Reporting and removal <p></p>
    <p>
            
    
    Help us to keep Florin County clean and tidy by correctly disposing of waste <p></p>and telling us about dumped rubbish. Fly-tipping is illegally dumping your rubbish and waste. This can be next to a public bin, a street corner, any public street, alleyway, grass verge or public land.  
    <p></p>
    Fly-tipping commonly includes:  <p></p>

    Black bin bags  <p></p>
    Items of furniture <p></p>
    Mattresses <p></p>
    DIY material. <p></p>
    Dumping waste is a crime <p></p>
    Dumping any waste is a criminal offence and you can be issued a £400 fixed <p></p>penalty notice on the spot. We can issue fines and/or imprisonment for those convicted of the offence. 

    <p></p>
    You can report fly-tipping online, on this website. You don't have to give your <p></p>details, but if you use your My Florin account to tell us about the problem, you will be able to track our progress.
