        <h1>Fly-tipping: Reporting and Removal</h1>

        <p>Help us keep Florin County clean and tidy by correctly disposing of waste and reporting dumped rubbish. Fly-tipping is the illegal dumping of rubbish and waste. This can occur next to a public bin, on a street corner, any public street, alleyway, grass verge, or public land.</p>
    
        <p>Fly-tipping commonly includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Black bin bags</li>
            <li>Items of furniture</li>
            <li>Mattresses</li>
            <li>DIY material</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Dumping waste is a crime. Dumping any waste is a criminal offense, and you can be issued a Â£400 fixed penalty notice on the spot. Fines and/or imprisonment can be imposed on those convicted of the offense.</p>
    
        <p>You can report fly-tipping online on this website. While you don't have to provide your details, if you use your My Florin account to report the problem, you will be able to track our progress.</p>
