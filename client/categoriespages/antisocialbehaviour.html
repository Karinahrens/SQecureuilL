        <h1>Anti-social Behaviour</h1>

        <p>Anti-Social Behaviour can include a wide range of nuisances, disorder, and crimes which affect people's lives on a daily basis. It can feel and look different in every area and to every victim. What might be considered anti-social by one person might be considered acceptable to another.</p>
    
        <p>The Home Office describes Anti-Social Behaviour as, '<em>any aggressive, intimidating or destructive activity that damages or destroys another person's quality of life</em>'.</p>
    
        <p>Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB) can cover a wide range of incidents and is dealt with by a number of different agencies. If ASB is not dealt with appropriately and in a timely manner, it can have a devastating impact on the lives of individuals, families, and communities.</p>
    
        <p>It is widely recognised that single agencies cannot tackle ASB alone and must work in partnership to address the issues.</p>
    
        <p>To ensure that your complaint reaches the appropriate team, please select the appropriate form below based on whether your complaint is related to Housing or street-based ASB.</p>
