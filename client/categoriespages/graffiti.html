        <h1>Graffiti</h1>

        <p>Graffiti refers to drawings, symbols, messages, or 'tags' that are painted, written, stencilled, or carved on walls and other surfaces. Graffiti can make an area look untidy and feel unsafe, and it can also be offensive.</p>
    
        <p>At Florin County, we take the issue of graffiti seriously and are committed to maintaining clean and attractive public spaces for our community. Here's how you can help:</p>
    
        <h2>Reporting Graffiti:</h2>
        <p>If you come across graffiti in your neighborhood or public areas, please report it to us promptly. Your reports help us address the issue and maintain the quality of our community spaces.</p>
    
        <p>When reporting graffiti, it's helpful to provide the following details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear photographs of the graffiti</li>
            <li>The exact location of the graffiti</li>
            <li>The date and time you first noticed it</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>By providing this information, you enable us to take appropriate action, which may include removal and investigation.</p>
    
        <h2>Graffiti Removal:</h2>
        <p>We have a dedicated team responsible for graffiti removal. Once graffiti is reported, we aim to remove it as quickly as possible to maintain the cleanliness and visual appeal of our community.</p>
    
        <h2>Community Involvement:</h2>
        <p>We also encourage community involvement in graffiti prevention and removal efforts. Organizing neighborhood cleanup events or mural projects can be effective ways to deter graffiti and beautify our surroundings.</p>
    
        <p>Together, we can ensure that Florin County remains a clean, safe, and vibrant place to live and work. Thank you for your cooperation in addressing the issue of graffiti.</p>       <p></p><button >Report </button>
