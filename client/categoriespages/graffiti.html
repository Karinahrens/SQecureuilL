       Graffiti <p></p>
       Graffiti are drawings, symbols, messages or 'tags' that are painted, <p></p>written, stencilled or carved on walls and other surfaces. 
       Graffiti can make an area look untidy and feel unsafe. It can also be <p></p>offensive. <p></p>
       Before you report graffiti to us, it’s helpful if you can take photos of <p></p>the graffiti and make a note of where it is and the time when you first saw it. We can use this as evidence if we arrest and charge someone for the offence.
