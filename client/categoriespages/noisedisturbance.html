        <h2>Steps You Can Take Before Making a Complaint</h2>
        <p>If you are affected by an ongoing noise problem, consider taking these steps first:</p>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Try to solve the issue in a friendly way by talking to the person or company causing the noise, if you feel comfortable with this.</li>
            <li>If this does not work, you could try taking other informal steps such as mediation or an informal letter to your neighbor.</li>
            <li>If you still can't solve the issue, report it to us using the online form below.</li>
        </ol>
