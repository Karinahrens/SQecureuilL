Help us to keep Florin County clean and tidy by correctly disposing of waste and telling us about dumped rubbish. Fly-tipping is illegally dumping your rubbish and waste. This can be next to a public bin, a street corner, any public street, alleyway, grass verge or public land.  
<p></p>
Fly-tipping commonly includes:  <p></p>

Black bin bags  <p></p>
Items of furniture <p></p>
Mattresses <p></p>
DIY material. <p></p>
Dumping waste is a crime <p></p>
Dumping any waste is a criminal offence and you can be issued a £400 fixed penalty notice on the spot. We can issue fines and/or imprisonment for those convicted of the offence. 

<p></p>
You can report fly-tipping online, on this website. You don't have to give your details, but if you use your My Florin account to tell us about the problem, you will be able to track our progress.

         Anti-social behaviour <p></p>
         
         Anti-Social Behaviour can include a wide range of nuisances, disorder and crimes which affects people's lives on a daily basis. It can feel and look different in every area and to every victim. What might be considered anti-social by one person, might be considered acceptable to another.
         <p></p>
The Home Office describes Anti-Social Behaviour as, 'any aggressive, intimidating or destructive activity that damages or destroys another person's quality of life'.
<p></p>
Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB) can cover a wide range of incidents and is dealt with by a number of different agencies. If ASB is not dealt with appropriately and in a timely manner it can have a devastating impact on the lives of individuals, families and communities.
<p></p>
It is widely recognised that single agencies cannot tackle ASB alone and must work in partnership to address the issues.
<p></p>
To ensure that your complaint reaches the appropriate team, please select the appropriate form below based on whether your complaint is related to Housing or street-based ASB

Drug-related activities taking place in or around the property<p></p>

        Streets not swept <p  class="justified-text">
        We sweep every residential street at least once a week. Busy shopping areas such as Riverside Avenue, Willowbrook Lane, Maplewood Street, Sunflower Boulevard, Brookside Drive, Cedarwood Crescent, Meadowview Lane and Oakridge Avenue are swept continuously between the hours of 6am to 10pm, seven days a week. 
        <p></p>
        Main highways are cleaned daily, in the mornings and again in the afternoon. Mechanical sweeping machines are used on our main roads and also assist in sweeping residential streets. 
        <p></p>
        As part of your road being swept, weeds are also removed by our staff, in conjunction with a programme of weed spraying that’s carried out three times a year. And our busy parks are cleared of litter during the summer six days a week.
